Application name: How I Got Started

This Android application was created for students who want to get an idea of what their future career will be like. The best way for them to
get an idea of what their future career will be like is to talk to professionals in the field that are already in the field they want
to pursue. I believe a mobile application would be a good way for the students and professionals to connect. The student will log into 
the appication (or sign up prior to logging in), answer a set of personality based questions, and get matched with professionals who 
have similar answers to those questions as the student. I believe if the student and professional were the same from a personality
standpoint, it would make for better advice giving as well as make for better advice adhering. 

Navigating through files/directories:

Most of the files/directories in this repository are created once a new project is created in Android Studio. The source code can be found by clicking "app",
then clicking "src" and then clicking "main". In the "java/krobertson/howigotstarted" directory within the "main" directory is where all 
of the java code is and in the "php" directory within the "main" directory is where all of the php code is. Each file within the 
"java/krobertson/howigotstarted" directory and the "php" directory contain descriptions of how the code works.
